      <description>What is the Dreameye? So I had no idea what this little device was before I was told about it from a friend. As it turns out, like the PS2, the Dreamcast also had an attachable webcam. Pictured below is a Dreameye, next to a PS2 EyeToy.

It was released to the Japanese market exclusively, with software called Visual Park.
So what about the weird file format?</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m a pretty boring guy, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d make a post about myself just to get that out of the way.
Development career To start off, I do all of the development work for the Twitch VTuber KazukiVT.1 Right now they are running a proprietary panel for their stream. It will be open-sourced eventually, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when.
I also do some web development on the side, though that&amp;rsquo;s pretty rare.</description>
