title: Starting my first game!

New blog, first post, new project!

Hey y'all! I've started working on my first game along with a close friend, Landis Buckley. He does all the art because I'm bad at it. Programmings is my jam.

It's a top-down RPG with a basic 16x16 artstyle similar to the Legend of Zelda. The project will be fully open source, too!

Hopefully that image worked, it's a short gif of the current menuy. Not dont yet, and the textures are slightly broken, but it'll do.
