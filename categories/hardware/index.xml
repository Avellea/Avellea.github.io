      <description>What is the Dreameye? So I had no idea what this little device was before I was told about it from a friend. As it turns out, like the PS2, the Dreamcast also had an attachable webcam. Pictured below is a Dreameye, next to a PS2 EyeToy.

It was released to the Japanese market exclusively, with software called Visual Park.
